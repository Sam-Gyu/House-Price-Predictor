# California Housing Price Prediction

This project demonstrates how to build a regression model to predict housing prices in California using the **California Housing Dataset** provided by `scikit-learn`.

## Features

- Uses **Scikit-learn** for all preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.
- Applies **Polynomial Features** to improve the input data for better accuracy.
- Trains a **Gradient Boosting Regressor** model (`HistGradientBoostingRegressor`) for high performance.
- Evaluates the model using the **RÂ² score**.
- Saves the trained model using **joblib**.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- joblib
